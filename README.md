### Instructions

1. **Run the main script**  
   This will execute the core algorithm and print the name of the saved result file.

2. **Generate results**  
   Open `result_read.py` and set the `file_name` variable to the printed file name:
   file_name = 'your_saved_file_name_here'

   Then run result_read.py to generate and visualize the results.
